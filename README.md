## Introduction

This project is a very basic implementation of a Ludo game created with React. The main functionality is to have player counters that increment with each turn, helping you understand React state management, components, and hooks.

## Features

- Turn-based counter for each player
- Basic state management using React hooks
- Interactive UI to switch turns and update counters

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/basic-ludo-counter-game.git
   cd basic-ludo-counter-game
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

### Running the Game

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to play the game.

## Game Rules

The basic rules implemented in this version of the Ludo game are:

1. The game consists of multiple players, each with a counter.
2. Players take turns incrementing their counters.
3. The counter for each player increases by 1 with each turn.

Note: This is a very basic implementation focusing only on the turn-based counter mechanism without a physical board or pieces.

## Code Overview

The project structure is as follows:

```
basic-ludo-counter-game/
├── public/

├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── PlayerCounter.js
│   ├── App.js
│   ├── index.js

```

- `src/components/PlayerCounter.js`: The component for displaying and updating each player's counter.
- `src/App.js`: The main application component managing the game state and turns.

### Example Code Snippet

Here's a brief example of how the counter might be implemented:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function PlayerCounter({ player, count }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{player}</h2>
      <p>Counter: {count}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

function App() {
  const [players, setPlayers] = useState([
    { name: 'Player 1', count: 0 },
    { name: 'Player 2', count: 0 },
    // Add more players as needed
  ]);

  const handleNextTurn = () => {
    setPlayers(prevPlayers =>
      prevPlayers.map((player, index) => ({
        ...player,
        count: player.count + 1
      }))
    );
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {players.map((player, index) => (
        <PlayerCounter key={index} player={player.name} count={player.count} />
      ))}
      <button onClick={handleNextTurn}>Next Turn</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
